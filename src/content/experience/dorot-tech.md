### tldr;

Launched and scaled a volunteer-driven tech support program during COVID to help isolated, primarily Russian-speaking older adults navigate essential technology. Partnered with the nonprofit DOROT to design weekly one-on-one and group Zoom sessions that taught critical skills like email, video calling, and online safety. Grew the program from just 10 participants to over 50 older adults and volunteers weekly, fostering real connections and improving digital independence during an especially isolating time. This initiative not only bridged a critical technology gap but also inspired my pursuit of computer science to build inclusive solutions that help underserved communities.

### full story

When COVID hit, like everyone else, I found myself stuck at home, watching the world shrink down to video games, phone calls with friends and playing with my guinea pig. However, during this period, I began to notice that many elderly people in my community, especially Russian-speaking immigrants, were basically completely cut off from the outside world. They didn’t know how to use the devices around them - devices that, during quarantine, had suddenly become their lifeline.

One moment in particular really stuck with me. My grandfather accidentally turned his phone to airplane mode, and for days we couldn’t get in touch with him. My parents eventually drove to his apartment, terrified that something had happened. Thankfully, he was completely fine, but it left me wondering: what about families who didn’t live nearby? What if an older adult’s phone stopped working and there was no one around to help? That question became the spark for an idea: a tech support program to bridge that gap.

I started by trying to create it myself. With a few friends, we put up flyers, reached out to mutual connections, and tried just about everything we could think of - it didn’t work. Most older adults weren’t leaving their homes nor were they online to see the emails we sent out. After hitting wall after wall, I realized I needed to work with a nonprofit that already had strong connections with the people we wanted to reach.

That’s when I connected with [DOROT](https://dorotusa.org/), a NGO in New York City that works with older adults. They not only understood the gravity of the issue, but they also had existing relationships with Russian-speaking seniors through their partnership with the [Shorefront YMCA](https://dorotusa.org/volunteer/high-school-college-internships/summer-teen-internship-program/brighton-beach) in Brighton Beach. From our first meeting, it felt like a perfect match. They were incredibly easy to work with and immediately gave us a list of older adults to contact and offered to support the program from the ground up.

Even with DOROT’s support, getting started definitely wasn’t easy. Most of the older adults we reached out to had never used Zoom before, so just getting them into a virtual meeting was its own lesson. We began with a small group - just five older adults and teen volunteers meeting weekly over Zoom. The sessions were one-on-one, helping with basic but important things: opening emails, making video calls to family, spotting spam messages. Over time, though, the program became about so much more than technical lessons. It became about connection and building real friendships.

After a few months, our little experiment had turned into something real. We onboarded more volunteers and started hosting larger group sessions - twenty or more people at once. Managing all those moving pieces was a challenge. People wanted to meet at different times, some volunteers struggled with reliability, and occasionally we’d have personality clashes. I remember one time when a teammate and I disagreed over how to teach a smartphone feature. Rather than argue in front of the group, I asked if we could step aside into a breakout room to talk it through. We decided to take turns explaining and let the guest decide which made more sense. It worked, and the guest actually liked hearing both explanations. That experience reminded me how important it was to handle conflicts calmly and keep the focus on the people we were helping.

Eventually, we got the chance to integrate the program into DOROT’s core online volunteer classes, called GENuine Connections. The expansion meant we could reach hundreds of older adults while still preserving our original focus on Russian-speaking seniors. We designed structured classes using slides to cover common tech topics but kept the one-on-one breakout rooms for individual questions - or just to chat. At our peak, more than 50 older adults and volunteers were showing up every week.

Walking into each session (really it was logging on) was a highlight of my week. The start of class was always a happy chaos - greetings and laughter in both English and Russian - before everyone moved into breakout rooms. I’d hop between rooms to check in and often found conversations that went far beyond tech support. People were building real friendships.

After running the program for a year and a half, I had to make a tough decision to wind it down when I started a full-time internship at Trillium (you can read more about that [here](/apbugs/experience/trillium-kb)). Ending the program was bittersweet, but I’m incredibly proud of what we were able to build: a volunteer-driven initiative that helped more than 50 older adults feel more connected and confident using technology during such an isolating period.

Looking back, this project taught me lessons I still carry with me. I learned how to stay organized and adaptable when plans fell apart. I learned how to set clear expectations for volunteers and balance empathy with accountability. Most importantly, I saw firsthand how even simple technology skills could completely change someone’s life by reconnecting them with family and friends.

The experience of running this program is what ultimately inspired me to pursue computer science. I realized that technology isn’t just about building cool tools - it can have a real impact on people’s lives, especially those who are often overlooked or forgotten. My goal now is to create software that makes life easier and more connected for everyone, no matter their age or background.

I will always think of those Zoom calls full of “hellos” in two languages as one of the most meaningful experiences I’ve ever had, and as a constant reminder of why I want to use computer science to help society.
