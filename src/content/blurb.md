Currently an undergraduate student at Cornell pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Math.

I'm mainly interested in **Full Stack Development**, particularly projects that integrate Machine Learning, however Iâ€™m also drawn to **Cybersecurity** and **Cloud Computing**. Additionally, I keep a close eye on advancements in Agritech and Quantum Computing.
