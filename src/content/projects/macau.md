This is a project that I created with a group of 3 of my friends for a AP Computer Science mid year project my Junior year. We used Java and the Scanner library to create an interactive single player card game called Macau which is very similar to Uno except it uses a 52 card deck. Our design utilizes OOP principles to simplify the game design and allow it to be modular and maintainable. We also implemented a computer player that automatically places cards automatically so that the user can play individually.

We started out with creating a project proposal, UML diagram, and flowchart (which can be found in the GitHub) and thinking about how our program would run. With this ground work in place, we started writing the code and creating the classes. We worked on classes separately, implementing black box testing and collaboration techniques.

Possible further improvements would be to create better Launch Codes in the Readme, add an option to play against another player (by clearing the screen and printing the next players information), and clean up the overall code because there are some redundant vestigial functions.
