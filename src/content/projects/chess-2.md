This is an extended version of my final project for CS 3110: Functional Programming and Data Structures. Expanded the scope by adding a single player mode using alpha-beta pruning and made it much more efficient using bit manipulation instead of arrays. 

Achieved an impressive 99% test coverage on non-UI project components on thousands LOC.
