This is my website!

I wanted to build a very simple and efficient site so that I can update my projects quickly and not have to worry about a whole lot.

You may be wondering what the strange date is. I really like philosophy, especially modern philosophy. It just so happens that one of the most famous modern philosophers, Kant and I share a birthday - but he was born exactly 281 years before me.
