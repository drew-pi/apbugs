Processing is very similar to Swing (another popular Java GUI) library. It is a single thread program that calls on visual objects that overwrite inherited functions. Each file except for the Woo.pde file (which is the runnable file) contains data to draw and react to other visual elements. The zombies are stored in a minimum heap (which we implemented ourselves) based on how much health they have and are released periodically.",

Processing needs to be downloaded separately so some instructions would be helpful for people who have never used it before.
